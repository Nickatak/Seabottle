I'm really tired of my RPI0's being near useless because they're so slow (I mean, really).  In an attempt to "speed things up," I want to write some C/C++ stuff, but C++ is such a pain, so I'm making this as an easy webserver framework (yeah, I'm aware Boost exists, but I want to learn and have some fun anyway).
